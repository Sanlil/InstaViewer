			<h2>About</h2>

			<h4>Usage</h4>
			<p>InstaViewer is a web application that allows you to look at and search for instagram pictures in your browser without any installation or login needed. You can both search by hashtags and usernames and then filter your result by additional words. There is 20 pictures loaded in one search and you can fetch more by scrolling to the end of the page.</p>

			<p>In the top navigation bar you can find a switch between grid mode, with thumbnail pictures, and list mode with full sized pictures. There is also a button for updating the search. In grid mode you also have the possibility to click on a picture to see it in full size with all related information.</p>

			<h4>Competitors</h4>
			<p>Of course there is many similar pages out there. Because Instagram is a mobile first application, the web app has not all the functionality that you would like and a lot of people have therefore made their own versions. Two examples are <a target="_blank" href="http://gramfeed.com">gramfeed.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://pinsta.me">pinsta.me</a> that both have the normal Instagram functionality but in a web application. Other more extreme examples are <a target="_blank" href="http://ink361.com">ink361.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://iconosquare.com">iconosquare.com</a> that has additional functionality as for example organizing photos and get statistics.</p>

			<p>Nevertheless, I believe that the advantage of InstaViewer is its simplicity and for example that you don't need an Instagram account to access the page. Therefore, If I expand this application, I will continue in the same way. One possible extension would for example be to implement functionality to search for locations. Maybe even include a map were you can pinpoint a location and get pictures taken in that area.</p>

			<h4>The Development</h4>
			<p>InstaViewer is a single page app based on the <a target="_blank" href="http://instagram.com/developer">Instagram API</a> and developed in <a target="_blank" href="http://angularjs.org">AngularJS</a> and the JavaScript library <a target="_blank" href="http://jquery.com">JQuery</a>. The application was made as a project in the course <i>DV1483 JavaScript, jQuery and AJAX with HTML5 and PHP</i> at Blekinge Institute of Technology.</p>The source code is available on <a target="_blank" href="http://sanlil.github.io">GitHub</a> and the course page on <a href="http://www.student.bth.se/~salp10/js/">student.bth.se/~salp10/js/</a>.</p>
